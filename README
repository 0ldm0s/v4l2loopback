--- INSTALL ---
--- BUILDING / INSTALLING ---
to build the kernel module run "make"
to install the module run "make install" (you might have to be 'root' to have
all nevessary permissions to install the module).

if your system has "sudo", do:
$ make && sudo make install

if your system lacks "sudo", do:
$ make
$ su
(enter root password)
# make install
# exit

--- RUN ---
Load the v4l2loopback module as root :
# modprobe v4l2loopback

using sudo use:
$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback

this will create an additional video-device, e.g. /dev/video0 (the number
depends on whether you already had video devices on your system), which can be
fed by various programs.
tested feeders:
	gstreamer: using the  "v4l2loopback" element 
		http://www.github.com/umlaeute/gst-v4l2loopback
	Gem(>=0.93) using the "recordV4L2" plugin
in theory most programs capable of _writing to_ a v4l2 device should work

the data sent to the v4l2loopback device can then be read by any v4l2-capable
application

--- OPTIONS ---
if you need several independent loopback devices, you can pass the "devices"
option, when loading the module; e.g.
# modprobe v4l2loopback devices=4
will give you 4 loopback devices (e.g. /dev/video1 ... /dev/video5)


--- KERNELs ---
the original module has been developed for linux-2.6.28;
further development has been done on linux-2.6.32 and linux-2.6.35, so these 2
are the last kernels known to work with this module
